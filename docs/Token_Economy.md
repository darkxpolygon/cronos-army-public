# **Token Utility**

$CA is not a speculative token — it is the **operating fuel of the Cronos Army ecosystem**.

### **Flow Summary**

- **Players spend $CA** for game actions
- **30–100% is permanently burned** depending on the action
- Revenue from credits/NFT sales → **buybacks** → more $CA burns
- Territory staking + upgrades → **long-term locking of supply**

This creates a **flywheel of deflation** as the player base grows.

## **Sustainability Model**

The ecosystem is built so **revenue grows faster than rewards.** 

**Revenue → Buybacks**

- In-game credit purchases
- NFT mints (Soldiers, Gear, Territories)
- Marketplace fees
- Cosmetic items

A portion of all revenue is used to:

→ **buy back $CA**

→ **burn it**

→ **power future game faucets**

**$CA → Permanent Burns**

- Territory mints
- AI actions
- Gear mints + fusions

Burns scale automatically with:

- DAU / MAU
- AI Soldier actions
- Marketplace volume

**Stable Payout Currency**

Rewards are paid in **CRO or USDC**, not in CA. This eliminates the classic “P2E token death spiral.”

Players sell CRO/USDC if they want — **not CA**.

**Net-Deflation Over Time**

The system is designed for:

- Increasing utility demand
- Decreasing circulating supply
- Growing locked supply
- Rising burn pressure via AI Soldiers

The more people play, the more CA disappears forever.
