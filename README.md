🎮 About Cronos Army

Cronos Army is a fully on-chain strategy game where players command AI-powered NFT soldiers that train, fight, evolve, and conquer.
The game is built with a single philosophy:

Hide the blockchain. Keep the benefits.

Players experience a frictionless strategy game, while all progression, logic, and ownership are transparently stored on-chain.

Key Features
	•	AI soldier behavior, memory, traits, and decision-making
	•	NFT-based units with evolving states
	•	Territory conquest + mission areas
	•	Fast, simple onboarding (no crypto jargon)
	•	Fully on-chain transparency
	•	Game economy designed for long-term sustainability

Cronos Army recently:
	•	Ranked #19 globally on PlayToEarn.com
	•	Nominated for Best Strategy Game 2025
	•	Attracted an active and growing community

Cronos Army is fully compatible with BNB Chain, and this public showcase repository includes configuration files prepared for deployment on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and opBNB environments.

📂 What’s in This Repository?

This repo is structured as a public-facing technical showcase, including:

1. /docs/ — Architecture & Design

Contains:
	•	System architecture diagrams
	•	High-level API descriptions
	•	Feature overviews
	•	Smart contract flow explanation
	•	Game loop outline
	•	AI soldier concept documentation

No sensitive code included.

⸻

2. /contracts-sample/ — Simplified Smart Contract Examples

Contains small, non-critical examples:
	•	Minimal ERC721 sample
	•	Example metadata structure
	•	Basic “soldier struct” for demonstration
	•	Sample upgrade handler (non-functional)

These files serve as representative samples, not production code.

⸻

3. /ui-sample/ — Lightweight Frontend Components

May include sample React components for:
	•	Soldier card UI
	•	Mission selector mockup
	•	Minimal wallet connect flow
	•	Example game panel layout

Real UI is significantly more advanced and private.

⸻

4. /api-sample/ — Mock API Endpoints

Contains illustrative code such as:
	•	Example GET /soldier/:id mock
	•	Fake mission response handler
	•	Sample MongoDB document structure

No real logic or secrets included.

⸻

5. /misc/ — Demo Assets & Notes
	•	UI sketches
	•	Non-sensitive prototype screenshots
	•	Early game UI versions
	•	Demo gifs (optional)

🧠 Development Philosophy

Cronos Army follows a pragmatic, iterative development model:
	1.	Ship fast
	2.	Test with real users
	3.	Improve weekly
	4.	Prioritize frictionless UX

The game is built in public — but core systems remain private for security, balance, and IP reasons.

⸻

🛡 Why Core Code Is Private

For transparency:

The following remain closed-source due to IP and security concerns:
	•	AI soldier behavior engine
	•	Territory logic
	•	Combat simulation
	•	Game balancing modules
	•	Production smart contracts
	•	Backend architecture
	•	Fraud-prevention logic

However, we happily walk ecosystem partners through the architecture during calls.
